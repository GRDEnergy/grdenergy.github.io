		<td><p>A listed national historical building in the heart of the San Francisco financial district, the Bently Reserve has a lot of stories to tell. It was built as a federal bank and has since seen a number of uses. In 2006 the new owners decided to retrofit the existing infrastructure and upgrade most of the building systems such as HVAC, lighting, access control and the fire life safety systems. Energy efficiency and sustainability measures, including LEED certification, are part of the ongoing upgrade efforts. GRD|energy is assisting the design team and the owner to bring an integrated solution for some of these systems and to commission all critical core and shell systems. New tenants include the Smith Group, Energy Foundation and the San Francisco Bar Association. http://bentlyreserve.com</p></td>

GRD|energy was engaged to make certain that the proposed ECM’s achieved their goals by commissioning some of the energy system involved. The projects resulting energy reductions are equivalent to the elimination of 7,400 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, about the same as could be converted by planting more than 2,000 acres of trees.</p></td>

With the help of the federal New Markets Tax Credit, San José transformed a marginal property into a showcase of energy- and water-efficient practices. The Environmental Services Department is the building owner and tenant coordinator. The EIC and services offered by its tenants contribute to San José’s Green Vision goals. These goals include: diverting waste from landfills, creating clean tech jobs, retrofitting buildings to be green, and replacing streetlights with smart zero emission lights. Other benefits accrue from the services offered by the EIC’s three tenants.</p></td>

The design team was using renewable energy such as photovoltaics and thermal solar hot water systems to reduce power and natural gas consumption. The building is already piped for reclaimed water to reduce the potable water use for industrial and landscape use. An innovative Night Sky cooling system provides pre-cooled water for the HVAC system, reducing the electric consumption for the chiller system. An extensive metering systems for consumption and production of utilities can be used to determine existing or future potential for additional reduction in consumption of utilities.</p></td>
